x <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out=100)
y <- sin(x) + rnorm(100, sd=0.2)
# Next, we can split the data into training and testing sets:
train_index <- sample(1:100, 70)
train_x <- x[train_index]
train_y <- y[train_index]
test_x <- x[-train_index]
test_y <- y[-train_index]

# we can train a KNN regressor on the training data:
library(class)
knn_model <- knn.reg(train_x, train_y, k = 5)
# Here, we're using a K value of 5.
# You can experiment with different values to see how they affect the model.
# Finally, we can use the trained model to make predictions on the test data:
predictions <- knn.reg(train_x, train_y, test_x, k = 5)
plot(test_x, test_y, main = "KNN Regressor Example")
lines(test_x, predictions, col = "red")
# This should give you a plot of the actual and predicted values.
# You can adjust the value of K to try to get better predictions.
